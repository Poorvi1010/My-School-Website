                <h3><kbd>Established in 2010</kbd></h3>
                <p class="text-success">Boarding at Candor is led by the belief that a healthy child needs the perfect combination of a good school and a caring, loving home. Candor offers an on-campus residential facility throughout the academic year, with both weekly and regular boarding in Bangalore, for students in Grade 5 to Grade 12. Weekly boarders reside at school from Monday to Friday and return home for the weekends, while regular boarders live on campus through the academic year. They are encouraged and guided to develop valuable skills and qualities such as communication, teamwork, leadership, empathy and cultural understanding, making boarders a happy community and an extended family.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p class="text-success">Candor believes that educational athletics is key to a studentâ€™s academic journey and this provides outstanding opportunities to teach very essential life lessons. Therefore interscholastic athletic participation is designed as an extension of the classroom. Numerous opportunities are planned in the academic year for general participation as well as for advanced training in specialized sports, to compete in tournaments and competitions against other schools across the country.

                    Students have access to a range of state-of-the-art sporting facilities such as: swimming, basketball, badminton, tennis, squash, snooker, cricket, taekwondo, football, table-tennis, yoga, aerobics, athletics, board games such as chess, carrom, etc. Professional coaches ensure that the students reach their potential and participate in intra and interschool competitions. After school activities are conducted for extra coaching in selected sports.
                    
                    We engage resident students with a multitude of weekend activities for students in their pursuit of a truly holistic education and the after-school activities run parallel to the athletics program. The numerous House sporting events regularly create a buzz around the campus which culminates in the excitement of Sports Day.</p>
                    <p class="text-success">The Candor School Community, like any vibrant and dynamic community, is made up of a rich diversity of personnel who fit into the various departments of the school.
                        A judicious blend of interdependence and autonomy is what makes the Candor community very special.
                        
                        Our community consists of our Students, Teaching staff, Coordinators, Administrative staff, Medical staff, Kitchen staff, Dorm Parents, a Personal Counselor, a College and Career Guidance Counselor, and a Special Educator, all of whom together add to the richness and diversity of the school.</p>
